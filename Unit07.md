**Unit 7: Future Considerations for International Organizations** <span
id="7"></span> 
*As the final unit for this course we will simultaneously take a look
backwards and forwards to discern possible patterns, trends, and
discontinuities in international government and governance.  Ultimately,
the adage “if you don’t learn from the past, history will repeat
itself,” while trite, is nonetheless appropriate here.  Thus, it is
incumbent upon us, the current and future participants in global
affairs, to learn from our collective past, identify current issues and
pursue reasoned, appropriate solutions for potential future problems.*

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 10 hours to complete.
