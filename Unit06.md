**Unit 6: Transnational Organizations** <span id="6"></span> 
*Transnational organizations are, as the name implies, organizations
that work across countries’ boundaries.  But, beyond this, they are
entities that are not defined in relationship to states.
 Hypothetically, if you eliminate all the states of the world,
transnational organizations could, and arguably would, still exist. 
Thus, this unit will survey such entities as professional associations,
cultural and religious entities, business/economic organizations, and
terrorist organizations.  Key dynamics herein are the extent to which
transnational organizations help or hinder other aspects of the global
governance and government.  Do such entities provide a useful supplement
to or undermine IGOs’ and INGOs’ activities as they address global
issues?  In what ways have other global participants reacted or
responded to transnational organizations?*

**6.3 In What Ways Do Transnational NGOs Impact Business Practices in a
Globalizing Economy?** <span id="6.3"></span> 
*In an international system defined in many ways by the forces and
interests of globalizing capital, we have witnessed an upswing of
transnational NGO activity that targets various labor issues.  These
include: wages, working conditions, the right to organize unions and
collectively bargain, and sexual harassment.  Assess if these issues
would be addressed if transnational NGOs were not in the picture.  As
outlined in sub-subunit 6.3.2, there are also attempts by transnational
NGOs to promote alternative business models focused on “Fair Trade.”*
