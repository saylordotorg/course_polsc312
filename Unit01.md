**Unit 1: Foundations of International Governance and Government** <span
id="1"></span> 
*International Organizations, as a subfield of International Relations,
has been shaped by two fundamental concepts: global government – the
formal institutions and global governance – and the decision-making
processes.  It is the intertwining of these two dynamics that gives rise
to various interpretations of what are essential political
questions – who gets what and why – in a global context.  Despite the
inherently interdependent nature of governance and government, this
first unit will separate them for a more thorough understanding of their
distinctiveness.  Subsequently, we will turn our attention to the
interplay between international organizations and international law.  
    
 A first consideration of global governance includes a brief look at
historical circumstances that have posed challenges for decision-making
in a global context.  While the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia (ending the 30
Years War) is generally credited with the birth of the state system, we
will limit our considerations to more contemporary dynamics: the Cold
War and post-Cold War periods, intensifying globalization (economic,
political, social, etcetera), and expanding civil society.  Concepts
such as balance of power, sovereignty, and legitimacy round out our
initial examination of governance and lead to a discussion of global
government.  
    
 Exploring global government also begins with a foundation of historical
contexts; here, however, we will reach back to the pre-World War I and
inter-war years before considering post-World War II developments in
formal international institutions.  A categorization of those
institutions based on the membership, primary functions, and mandates
(scope of their activities) provides a foundation for later units that
will compare and contrast various global and regional international
organizations.  Terminology such as ‘intergovernmental,’
‘nongovernmental,’ and ‘transnational’ will be delineated along with
‘global,’ regional,’ and ‘sub-regional’ designations.  
    
 Having completed a brief introduction to the governance and government
concepts, our attention turns to international law and international
organization(s) relationships.  The last subunit herein differentiates
among the various sources of international law and reflects on some of
the major issues that confront the nexus of law and organization:
implementation, compliance, and enforcement.  For those individuals not
familiar with international law, this serves as an introduction to
relevant aspects of the topic; it provides a refresher for those who
have already studied international law.*
