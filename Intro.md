This course will provide you with a basic understanding of two core
concepts in International Relations and, more generally, Political
Science: international governance and international government. 
Governance refers to the processes of decision-making, while government
is the formal institutions associated with those processes. These two
dynamics are interdependent; it is necessary to study both to fully
understand this subfield of international relations. Thus, this course
will serve as the basis for further studies in the International
Relations field within the Political Science major; it also serves as a
companion course or “alter-ego” for the International Law course. You
will begin studying the fundamental issues of international organization
by exploring some conceptual frameworks pertaining to governance
dynamics.  This will be followed by investigating the three primary ways
in which the participants in global affairs, both state and non-state
actors, organize themselves: intergovernmental, nongovernmental and
transnational organizations.  The United Nations will be given special
attention due to the truly global scope of its activities and impact. 
Your examination of the formal institutions will include questions
pertaining to their structures, functions, activities and relevance for
global events and issues.  Throughout your studies you will compare and
contrast political/security, social/humanitarian and economic
organizations; global and regional organizations and, finally, single
and multipurpose organizations. By the end of the course, you will have
a firm understanding of the interplay between international governance
and government and how they shape international relations.

### Course Information

Welcome to POLSC312.  Below please find general information on this
course and its requirements.  
    
 **Course Designers:** Marchéta Wright  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   Friedrich Ebert Foundation's [Digitale
    Bibliotek](http://library.fes.de/cgi-bin/populo/digbib.pl?f_SET=dialogue%20on%20globalization&f_SER=briefing&t_listen=x&sortierung=jab)
-   University of Ghent: Encyclopedia of Law and Economics: Alexander
    Thompson and Duncan Snidal’s [“International
    Organization”](http://encyclo.findlaw.com/tablebib.html)

**Requirements for Completion:** This course is designed in a somewhat
modular manner.  Each unit, while being discrete, nonetheless builds
upon previous material.  Therefore, at times you will need to refer back
to previous units as you progress through the material.  As an advanced
level undergraduate course, POLSC312 entails comparative analysis of the
diverse organizations and theoretical concepts that are its
foundations.  Political Science in general and International Relations
in particular, relies on the nexus of political, economic, social, and
cultural dynamics for a full, rigorous understanding of world affairs. 
You will also need to complete the Final Exam.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all of the resources in each unit.  
    
 The successful completion of this course requires that you earn a 70%
or higher on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated
as soon as you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take
it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** In general, this course should take approximately
**104 hours** to complete.  However, please keep in mind that these are
rough estimates.  The expectation is that each person will work at
her/his own pace.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  Thus, the
time advisories are meant as general guidelines, not ‘hard and fast’
rules for completing each unit.  It may be helpful to review the time
advisories for a unit, subunit or reading prior to beginning that
section; this will enable you to set realistic goals and manage your
time in an effective, efficient manner.  For example, Unit 1 should take
3.5 hours to complete and Unit 2 should take 8 hours to complete. 
Perhaps you can sit down with a calendar and decide to complete Unit 1
(a total of 3.5 hours) on Monday; subunit 2.2 (a total of 4 hours) on
Tuesday; subunit 2.3 (a total of 4 hours) on Wednesday; etc.
