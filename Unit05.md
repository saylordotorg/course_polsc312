**Unit 5: International Non-Governmental Organizations** <span
id="5"></span> 
*INGOs, international non-governmental organizations, have grown in both
number and scope over roughly the last century and, in particular, since
the end of WWII.  Collectively they form a counterpoint or balance to
the work of IGOs.  By definition they are not affiliated with any
particular governmental entity.  Thus, their impartiality has enabled
them to engage in advocacy with respect to key global issues in ways
that are not possible for the governments of states in the context of
IGOs.  This unit, then, will survey the types of INGOs with an emphasis
on their contributions to global governance and government.  In essence,
what do they contribute to the processes and institutional dynamics of
the international organizations?  In answering this question, you will
turn your attention to INGOs relationships with IGOs as well as with
other INGOs.  As with the previous unit on the UN, you also will assess
the effective of INGOs in the context of their own mandates and
activities.*

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Compare and contrast various INGOs with respect to their
    mandates/focus and types of activities.
-   Analyze INGOs within and across issue-areas emphasizing their impact
    on international governance.
-   Compare and contrast INGOs with respect to their role in
    international governance.

**5.1.1 Relationships with the UN** <span id="5.1.1"></span> 
*Nongovernmental organizations may be granted Observer Status with the
United Nations.  Various levels or categories of this status indicate
the degree to which a particular INGO may participate in UN
deliberations.  The highest category enables the designated organization
to attend and actively participate (short of voting) in virtually all UN
sessions.  Less extensive permissions limit the UN organs or agencies
with which the INGO may interact, the degree of proactive v. observing
participation, or both.*

**5.2 What Roles Do Regional and Subregional INGOs Play with Respect to
International Governance?** <span id="5.2"></span> 
*As with the global arena, the relationship between IGOs and INGOs can
be both cooperative and contentious.  The relationship may be either
much more intense – positively or negatively – given the somewhat
narrower context within which the organizations’ interactions take
place.  The specific geopolitical region and its dynamics can, in fact,
contribute to the willingness of organizations to address situations and
simultaneously create seemingly intractable problems and tensions for
the organizations’ relationships.  The diverse NGO case material below
underscores and exemplifies such dynamics.*

**5.3 How Do NGOs Link Diverse Issues to Enhance Global Governance?**
<span id="5.3"></span> 
*Quite often NGOs will link seemingly divergent issues together when
engaging in problem solving activities.  Essentially, it is a
horizontal, integrated or ‘multi-tasking’ rather than a hierarchical,
top-down prioritizing approach to problem solving.  Such an approach by
NGOs may be particularly effective when resources are limited.*
