**Unit 2: International Relations Theories and International
Governance** <span id="2"></span> 
*Numerous theoretical perspectives have evolved in the discipline of
international relations.  Among them, you will examine various
permutations of Realism, Liberalism, Marxism, and Regime theory.  The
focus of the material is the relevant aspects of each theory for
international organizations given that this is not a course in ‘IR’
theory.  Hence, core concepts such as the participants in
international/global relations, power, sovereignty, and interdependence
will shape your studies.  In general, the theories can be separated into
two groups: mainstream theories and theories of marginalization.  The
first group embraces those theories that emerged to explain the, then
perceived to be, principal dynamics of international affairs between
discrete participants: inter-state relationships.  In essence, these
theories are state-centric or, at the very least, state-oriented.  The
latter theories, as a group, attempt to take a more holistic approach to
global relationships and thereby emphasize the connections and
relationships that characterize ‘have’ and ‘have-not’ interactions in
global affairs.  Thus, non-state actors such as individuals,
corporations, indigenous peoples, and terrorist groups enter into the
equation.  As with the previous unit, historical contexts are a part of
our inquiries. *

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Define the core concepts of IR theory noting the differences between
    theories.
-   Compare and contrast the ‘Mainstream’ theories with the theories of
    ‘Marginalization’ emphasizing their relevance for international
    governance and government.
-   Analyze the potential for regimes to contribute to or hinder
    international governance.

**2.1 Overview of IR Theory** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*As with any academic discipline, the role of theory is imperative to
give us analytical leverage when exploring issues in the international
arena including the behavior of International Organizations. 
International Relations theory allows us to contextualize and provide
insights into why and how International Organizations act in the
international system.  IR  theory also serves as a framework to predict
future behavior of  International Organizations.  We can recognize five
broad schools of  IR theory: Realism, Liberalism, Constructivism,
Marxism, and Feminism.  As you read the resource below, make sure you
are clear on the following questions: (1) What is the organizing
principle of the theory?  (2) Who are the main actors in each
theoretical framework?  (3) What are the goals of these actors? and  (4)
What are the core capabilities of these actors that produces particular
patterns of behavior?*

**2.2 How Have the ‘Mainstream’ IR Theories Shaped International
Organizations?** <span id="2.2"></span> 
*As you read through the various mainstream  theories and how they have
shaped International Organizations (IOs), make sure you are clear on
what each theory says about the following: (1) What explains the
emergence of IOs in the last century?  (2) How much power should IOs
have in the international system vis-à-vis powerful states?  (3) Can we
predict IO behavior?  If so, what variables should we examine? and  (4)
What explains cooperation in the international system?*

**2.3 How Do Theories of Marginalization Expand Our Studies of
International Organizations?** <span id="2.3"></span> 
*Theories of Marginalization (also described as “critical theory”)
challenge the assumptions of ‘Mainstream’ IR theory.  Marxist oriented
theory argues that an understanding of the international system requires
an analysis that interlinks political outcomes with dynamics that arise
out of modern capitalism.  Marxists argue that structures of power in
the international system, including prominent IGOs,  are a by-product of
the spread of global capitalism that privileges some states,
organizations, groups, and individuals while significantly constraining
others.  Neo-Marxists focus on the role that ideology plays in
facilitating hierarchical power relations in the international system.
 Here, the focus is often how global elites, including those who work in
prominent IGOs, help restructure and reinforce a global order supportive
of the interests of transnational capital.  Dependency and World System
theorists focus on the historical dynamics that have produced the
dramatic gap in wealth between developed and developing countries.
 Feminist theory focuses on issues of patriarchy and gender
construction.  As you read through the theories, evaluate if each of
these ‘Theories of Marginalization’ makes a relevant contribution to the
study of International Organizations.*

**2.4 What Is Regime Theory and Does It Make a Significant Contribution
to IO Studies?** <span id="2.4"></span> 
*The concept of international regimes emerged during the last quarter
century of the 1900s in response to the increasing complexities of
international and global governance.  After considerable discussion by
scholars in the international relations discipline, the discourse was
formalized in “International Regimes," a special issue of the journal
International Organization (volume 36 spring 1982).   In essence, an
international regime is seen as a collection of regional and/or global
participants — states, NGOs, multi- or transnational corporations, IGOs,
even individuals — that coalesce around a particular issue, e.g. trade,
human rights, disarmament, the environment.  Regimes, then, are not
single organizations.  Rather, the participants establish norms, rules,
and procedures to facilitate their interaction focused on the issue at
hand. *
