**Unit 3: Intergovernmental Organizations - IGOs** <span id="3"></span> 
*Intergovernmental Organizations – IGOs – are one of several types of
organizations that make up the institutional or governmental structures
of international and global relations.  In this unit, you will examine
the differences between global, regional, and subregional
organizations.  For example, the United Nations is a global IGO, while
the Organization of American States and League of Arab States represent
regional IGOs; subregional IGOs include the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and the Economic Organization of West African States
(ECOWAS).  Another distinguishing feature of IGOs is the extent to which
they are single or multipurpose.  The former type of IGOs has narrow,
highly focused mandates or sets of purposes; this is exemplified by the
Interamerican Commission on Human Rights.  Others have mandates that are
very broad in scope; such multipurpose IGOs include the United Nations
and African Union.  Thus, an IGO can be global, regional, or subregional
and simultaneously single or multipurpose in scope.  
    
 The unit begins with a brief introduction to the United Nations before
turning to a consideration of other IGOs.  The UN, because of its
significance for international organizations, receives much greater
attention in Unit 4.*

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Differentiate between global, regional, and subregional IGOs and
    between multipurpose and single purpose IGOs.
-   Characterize, compare, and contrast the various regional IGOs with
    respect to functions, mandates and impact on international
    governance.
-   Discuss, compare, and contrast subregional IGOs within and across
    regions with respect to their functions, mandates, and impact on
    international governance. 

**3.1 What Are Global IGOs?** <span id="3.1"></span> 
*This first subunit introduces and differentiates among the various
types of IGOs based on membership and the geopolitical scope of their
activities.  Global IGOs are those that essentially undertake activities
on a world-wide scale, have state membership that is completely
inclusive of all states, or nearly so.  The UN is currently the only
multipurpose global IGO; single purpose global IGOs are exemplified by
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD or World
Bank) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).*

**3.1.1 An Overview of the United Nations (UN)** <span
id="3.1.1"></span> 
*The material here is meant to provide a somewhat cursory introduction
to the UN system.  You should gain a general sense of the UN’s role as
the premier global international governmental institution.  In addition,
after reviewing the UN webpage and some of its links, you should be
familiar with the scope and content of its world-wide activities.*

**3.1.1.1 Successor of the League of Nations** <span

-   **Reading: The BBC: Charles Townshend’s “The League of Nations and
    the United Nations”**
    Link: The BBC: Charles Townshend’s [“The League of Nations and the
    United
    Nations”](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/league_nations_01.shtml)
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the material
    on the webpage.  You may navigate to various sections of the reading
    by using the links to the left of the article.   
        
     The League of Nations was the precursor – some would say ‘first
    generation’ – of the United Nations.  As such it constitutes the
    first truly comprehensive effort by the community of states to
    engage in international government and governance.  While ultimately
    a failed attempt, the League provided valuable lessons for
    subsequent undertakings of both government and governance. 
    Townshend’s article discusses the political tensions within the
    League of Nations and contrasts it with the emergent UN.

**3.1.1.2 The Role of the UN in Global Governance** <span
id="3.1.1.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: The United Nations’ “UN at a Glance”**
    Link: The United Nations’ [“UN at a
    Glance](http://www.un.org/)[”](http://www.un.org/) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: The ‘UN at a Glance’ link takes you to the homepage
    of the UN.  Once there, click on the preferred language link. 
    Peruse the page noting the various issues (row of buttons just under
    the banner), topic areas within the UN structure, and resources and
    services provided by the UN.  After familiarizing yourself with the
    webpage, go to the ‘Your United Nations’ blue box near the top
    center of the page; click on the ‘UN at a Glance’ link;  it’s the
    first one in the box.  Read the material on this page.  Finally,
    return to the previous page, and explore the various links in the
    ‘In Focus’ box near the top right of the page.  
        
     Familiarizing yourself with the UN website should raise your
    awareness of the extensive scope of activities undertaken by this
    global IGO.  Specific questions begin to emerge:  
        
     How have the two pillars of the UN – human rights and collective
    security – given rise to the myriad of issues currently addressed by
    the UN?  
     What is the relationship between the various principal actors of
    the UN?  
     What is the source of UN funding, and what other types of resources
    does it rely on to further its governance activities?  
        
     Finally, the significance of the UN ultimately rests in the fact
    that it is the only organization that has as its members all but one
    state in the world (the Vatican).  Thus, it is the only truly global
    organization that undertakes governance to such an extensive breadth
    and depth.  
        
     Studying this resource and considering the questions above should
    take approximately 30 minutes to complete.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the links above, and read each
    article in its entirety.  
        
     This material provides an overview of the Bretton Woods
    institutions – mechanisms of global government – before we examine
    each institution itself.  The Bretton Woods conference resulted from
    a meeting in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, USA in July, 1944.  The
    agreement gave rise to two institutions that were to further
    international government and governance in the areas of economic
    development and financial relationships: The International Bank for
    Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Monetary
    Fund (IMF).  As “partner” or “sister” organizations of the UN, the
    IMF’s and IBRD’s activities also are global in scope; and, like the
    UN, they have been fraught with controversy over the years.  While
    the IBRD and IMF clearly have contributed to various countries’
    development, both institutions have been the subject of innumerable
    charges of unethical and detrimental policies, practices and
    programs.  In general, the criticisms have centered on the
    dislocation of local communities and environmental degradation in
    various forms.  In addition, many economists have been critical of
    the economic conditions or ‘strings’ attached to the various
    programs and aid packages put forth by the two organizations.

    pages are an executive summary and annex of supporting material.)  
        
     Beginning in the 1970s, the IBRD has been increasingly criticized
    for controversial development projects.  The primary criticism
    focuses on the questionable short term benefits of various projects
    in light of medium and long term detrimental consequences for the
    quality of life of local communities and the environment.  In short,
    the IBRD has been at or near the center of the development v.
    sustainable development debate.  Innumerable cases in Asia, Africa,
    and Latin America provide evidence for the ongoing negative
    assessment of this IGOs practices.  The reading for this subunit
    reviews the IBRD’s overall framework for development at its impact
    on climate change.

    addition, please pay particular attention to commentaries on the
    evolution of the IMF – how it has changed since its inception in
    1944 as global economic and financial conditions have changed. 
    Finally, please note the IMFs institutional structure as well as the
    processes of decision-making.  It is significant to note how the IMF
    differs from the IBRD with respect to its activities, membership,
    and scope of governance activities.  The short video clips are
    particularly useful; they highlight and provide examples and
    evidence to support the analysis in the text.

     The WTO is the most recent manifestation of international
    governance and government that focuses on trade.  It is a much more
    highly structured and institutionalization of decision-making,
    policy formulation, implementation, and enforcement than any of its
    predecessors.  An international trade organization – the ITO – was
    actually a part of the 1948 ‘Havana Charter’ that is generally
    credited with the ‘birth’ of the WTO.  The failure to implement the
    ITO is typically characterized as the inability to resolve
    entrenched differences between the ‘North’ and the ‘South.’

     The WTO has garnered much attention and criticism since its
    inception in 1995 at the Uruguay Round negotiations of GATT (General
    Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).  Its annual meetings are routinely
    the occurrence of world-wide protests — the focal of which is the
    on-going debate between free trade and fair trade.  This reading,
    after a brief description of the organization, reviews various
    substantive areas of WTO activity; for example, agriculture, special
    or differential treatment, and nonagricultural markets.  The
    analysis then shifts to considering the tensions between the WTO and
    multilateral, regional, bilateral, and pluryilateral approaches to
    governance in this issue area.

**3.2 How Do Regional IGOs Contribute to International Governance?**
<span id="3.2"></span> 
*This subunit continues our exploration of IGOs by focusing on those of
a regional nature.  Specifically, the Organization of American States
(OAS), European Union (EU), African Union (AU), and League of Arab
States (Arab League) provide us with case studies of such
organizations.  As a set, they provide us with an overview of the
historical development and evolution of regional international
governmental institutions, as well as the governance processes employed
by them.  
    
 The readings for this subunit are particular to each organization being
studied.  As you review the material, it is important to note the
similarities and differences among the organizations at each ‘level’ –
regional or subregional.  It is equally as important to compare and
contrast the organizations from the different geopolitical regions.  Pay
particular attention to the scope and purposes, structures, and
decision-making processes and issues.  To what extent do the
organizations differ because of differences in the regions and
sub-regions themselves – culture, key issues, history, etc.?  Finally,
Asia does not have a comparable regional organization.  Might this be
because of the extreme geographic size, or socio-political and economic
diversity of the region?  Or is there some other reason that might
explain this lack?*

     While this reading’s central theme is security, the analysis
    remains relevant for challenges facing regional IGOs that address
    other issues.  In essence, the author observes that people the world
    over express a growing sense of insecurity despite the fact that the
    number of armed conflicts, coups, et cetera have decreased.  Her
    explanation for this may be generalized to other issue areas such as
    human rights, the environment, or economic relations.

     Instructions: This link provides access to the OAS webpage for the
    Charter.  To access the readings, scroll down and click links for
    Chapters I – VII.  The key to this reading lies in understanding how
    states choose to organize themselves in a regional context.  For the
    Americas one dilemma is the extreme diversity of states in the
    region with respect to political, economic, and social
    characteristics; the region contains arguably the ‘most powerful’
    and among the ‘least powerful’ states in the world.  How, then, to
    create an effective institution – in essence a government – for
    fostering global governance when the member states are at such
    variance?  The tension between the Idealists’ assertion that all
    states are equal due to sovereignty (see unit 2) and Realists’ claim
    that power is the determining characteristic of state behavior plays
    out in the OAS’s structure, functioning and effectiveness.

    Insulza.  He discusses the key issues of democratic institutions,
    poverty, and the OAS’s interactions with specific countries in Latin
    America.  Regarding the first, he explores the tensions between
    regional IGOs intervention and state sovereignty.  Improvements and
    setbacks in the area of poverty are cast in the light of the
    Millennium Development Goals.  The Secretary General then continues
    with a discussion of the OAS’s activities with respect to various
    states, in particular Cuba and Venezuela.  The issues of crime, drug
    trafficking and jobs, among others, round out the discussion.

    page.  There are various links within the text that may be of
    interest; they provide additional information about the key issues
    and functions of the EU.  Some of these will be explored in
    subsequent subunits.  Somewhat more extensive readings are provided
    for this regional IGO, because the EU, arguably, has undergone the
    most complex evolutionary changes since its inception.  It remains,
    along with the UN, one of the ‘grandest experiments’ in
    international governance and government; it requires setting aside
    state sovereignty and unprecedented levels of cooperation and
    coordination of policies among a very diverse groups of
    countries.   
        
     Members of the EU (as of December, 2011): Austria, Belgium,

    on the ‘read more about the decade …’ link for the full text of the
    reading.  The embedded maps provide an effective visual indication
    of the evolution of the EU’s membership.   Beyond this, the
    reading’s focal points revolve around the ways in which regional and
    global events such as oil crises, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and
    the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 have shaped the EU’s role in regional
    and global governance.  Finally, the institutional structures of the
    EU arguably provide a blueprint for more far reaching governmental
    institutions.  This is, of course, assuming it survives the
    financial crisis of the early part of this century.

     Instructions: Each of the links above provides the reading for that
    specific institution of the EU.  The key thread that runs through
    all of these readings is the complexity and extensiveness of this
    particular regional IGO’s activities.  Among such organizations, the
    EU has taken the most balanced approach to legislative, judicial,
    and executive functions, roles, and issues.  Beyond this, the highly
    integrated nature of the formal institutions – government – and
    processes – governance – is illustrative of the dynamic interplay of
    each component being studied in this course.

    seemingly dominated any resource and development discussions about
    this region, it is, arguably, water that has and will continue to be
    the basis for the most contentious relationships within the Middle
    East.  We are all familiar with the ongoing, seemingly endless
    nature of the Middle East conflict with its most recent
    manifestation being between Israel and the Palestinian people. 
    However, what is often not included in the analysis of this region’s
    tensions is the underlying issue of water scarcity.  This article
    aptly presents the dynamics of this issue and its significance for
    governance in the region.

**3.3 How Do Sub Regional IGOs Facilitate Governance and Government?**
<span id="3.3"></span> 
*The purpose of this subunit is to further detail the roles of IGOs with
respect to international government and governance.  Sub-regional IGOs
are key players because they are the ‘locals’ on the scene in global
governance terms.  Quite often they can better identify problems and
facilitate appropriate solutions because of their proximity to the
situation.  The converse also has been argued; sub-regional IGOs are too
entrenched in ‘local’ political and economic dynamics to remain
effectively impartial.  This potentially is the most problematic with
respect to conflicts in general and armed conflicts in particular. 
Therefore, unlike the previous sections of this unit, the focus herein
is on the activities of certain subregional IGOs rather than their
organizational structures and internal operational procedures.  As you
review the various materials below, think in comparative terms about the
issues or problems faced by each organization and the choices made to
address them.  Finally, please keep in mind that the organizations
herein are merely a sample; each region has a plethora of subregional
organizations.  Some are quite narrow in scope and activity, while
others are rather broad and inclusive regarding the issues being
tackled.*

**3.3.1 Africa: ECOWAS & SADC – The Economic-Conflict Nexus** <span
id="3.3.1"></span> 
*The readings on African sub-regional IGOs underscore the nexus of armed
conflict and economic activity for the states of that continent.  While
popular culture films such as Blood Diamond and Lord of War dramatize
some of these dynamics, the realities for the African people are far
more real and horrific.  The question remains: can African subregional
IGOs build on past successes – however few they may be – and continue to
have a positive impact on conflict resolution and sustainable economic
development in Africa?*

**3.3.2 Asia: ASEAN & APEC – Economic Development . . . Sustainability
Challenges** <span id="3.3.2"></span> 
*The Asian region, arguably even more so than Africa, is exceptionally
diverse with respect to geographic, sociopolitical, and cultural
characteristics.  Therefore, numerous sub-regional IGOs have developed
in Asia.  It is also worth remembering at this juncture that there is no
regional IGO in Asia comparable to the OAS, AU, or EU.  The two
subregional IGOs profiled herein exemplify key governance issues and
problems that beset the region and the
institutional *– *government *– *attempts to address them.*

*There is often a bit of confusion between two distinct yet related
organizations: the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries – OPEC
and the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries – OAPEC.  In
general, OAPEC is a separate organization whose membership overlaps
somewhat with that of OPEC.  It is OAPEC that is the focus of this
particular section on sub-regional IGOs.*

    courts to grant reparations for past damages sustained by indigenous
    peoples and individuals.  Thus, the article provides a glimpse into
    courts and law as instruments of global and regional governance.
