**Unit 4: The United Nations** <span id="4"></span> 
*Two focal points form the foundation for our exploration of the United
Nations and its role in global governance and government.  The first is
the UN’s structure; of importance here is to note the ways in which the
six primary organs – the General Assembly, Security Council, Economic
and Social Council, International Court of Justice, Secretariat, and
Trusteeship Council *–* have discrete yet related functions within the
organization.  Beyond this, the specific decision-making mechanisms of
each organ correspond to and reflect that organ’s purpose.  The second
topic within this unit addresses the effectiveness of the UN in the
context of global governance and government.  Here, you will study the
two pillars of the UN: protecting and promoting human rights and
collective security/peacekeeping.  For each, specific case studies are
examined to assess the extent to which the UN has been successful, or
not, in meeting its goals and mission.  In the end, it is important to
understand that the UN, like the European Union and African Union, is
still a ‘work in progress;’ that is, it continues to evolve and develop
to meet the ever-changing needs of the global community as a whole and
its individual members.*

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Describe and differentiate between the primary organs of the UN,
    paying particular attention to their structures, purposes and areas
    of responsibilities.
-   Compare and contrast the specialized agencies of the UN with respect
    to their structures, purposes and areas of responsibilities.

**4.1 What Is the Overall Structure of the UN and How Has It Evolved
since Its Inception in 1945?** <span id="4.1"></span> 
*This subunit will provide you with an overview of the United Nations
and its associated organizations through reading its founding document:
The Charter of the United Nations.  The various chapters of this
document will describe the six primary organs’ governing structures and
processes (membership, voting, etc.), purposes, and areas of
responsibilities.  In addition, you will explore a sampling of the
specialized agencies of the UN.  The emphasis here is to compare and
contrast them with respect to what they do and how they do it.  Note the
range – narrow or broad – of their activities and the geopolitical
regions of the world in which they operate.*

**4.1.2 Specialized Agencies** <span id="4.1.2"></span> 
*This subunit focuses on exemplary cases of specialized agencies and
associated organizations of the United Nations.  As you read the
materials, pay particular attention to the similarities and differences
among the organizations.  For example, how does each organization govern
itself in terms of both structure and process, that is, how does it make
decisions?  Of equal importance are the mandate or purpose of each
organization and the corresponding agenda – set of issues/topics in
which it engages.  Note the breadth or narrowness of focus and the
depth/detail of some of the topics, issues, and activities.  Also, note
the various geopolitical regions of the world in which the organization
is active.*

     The second link takes you to an alphabetized list of specific
    projects of the WHO.  Review the list and notice the incredibly wide
    range of activities of this specialized agency of the UN.  It
    becomes clear why the term ‘multipurpose’ organization is so
    appropriate.

    can be resized for clarity).  The second link will take you to the
    UNEP’s “Six Priorities.”  Under the headings are six icons
    representing each of the priorities.  They are, in order: Climate
    Change, Disasters and Conflicts, Ecosystem Management, Environmental
    Governance, Harmful Substances, and Resource Efficiency.  You may
    read this material in four of the six official languages of the
    United Nations: Chinese (Mandarin), English, French or Spanish.  To
    access the document in the preferred language, click on the
    appropriate link to the far right in the ribbon at the top of the
    page.  
        
     The significance of this material lies in understanding the
    complexity of some IGOs that seems to be inconsistent with the
    apparent ‘single purpose’ nature of their mandate.  However, despite
    the UNEP ‘only’ being concerned with environmental issues, the
    ‘Organigram’ reinforces the multiplicity of what constitutes ‘the
    environment.’

**4.2.1 Human Rights & Humanitarian Activities** <span
id="4.2.1"></span> 
*Protecting and promoting human rights is one of the two cornerstones of
the UN.  As this responsibility is quite broad, it comprises the single
largest area of UN activity.  The range of its involvement includes
determining operational definitions and legal frameworks for the most
severe violations *– *genocide, torture, etc. *– *to creating local,
regional and global infrastructures that identify and deliver basic
human needs *– *clean water, health care, education, etc.  UN human
rights activities have been fraught with tensions and controversies
since the inception of the organization despite the seemingly
straightforward nature of this work.  The cases profiled below provide
insight into the past and ongoing human rights activities of the UN.
 Following the cases is a section on key international legal documents
that are critical for the UN’s work.  As you review the materials below
please consider the extent to which you think the UN has been successful
in accomplishing this part of its mandate.  What criteria are you using
to assess the UN’s behavior in this context?  Why?*

     Instructions: This link takes you to the ‘Ghosts of Rwanda’ page on
    FreeDocumentaries.  Click on the ‘Watch Film Now’ link to watch the
    film.  The Rwandan genocide has come to be the most flagrant example
    of the UN’s failure to take appropriate, timely action to prevent
    this egregious form of human rights violations.  As you watch the
    documentary, consider the various points at which decision were or
    were not made and how the situation could have been resolved in a
    different manner.  Is the failure of the UN the result of
    structural/organizational flaws or the lack of political will to
    make tough decisions on the part of the members?  Does the film
    underscore the, at times, seemingly indecisive nature of the UN
    membership (keep in mind that the organization is made up of
    independent, autonomous states) or of a fundamental weakness in the
    institutional structure of the UN itself?

     China’s tumultuous relationship with Tibet is the subject of this
    documentary.  In essence, the government of China has claimed Tibet
    as part of its territory and undertaken policies to solidify that
    claim.  For example, immigration to Tibet by Chinese nationals is
    strongly encouraged, thus increasing the Chinese population of
    Tibet.  The decades-long situation highlights the unresolved
    tensions between state sovereignty, self-determination, and
    humanitarian intervention.  Each concept is at the core of the UNs
    mandate and operations; nonetheless, the organization has yet to
    establish a coherent set of guidelines to balance the claims of
    sovereignty by governments with people’s cries for
    self-determination and the protection of basic human rights and
    needs.  As with the Rwandan situation, how might the UN change its
    decision-making processes and structures to better facilitate a
    positive resolution to the situation?
